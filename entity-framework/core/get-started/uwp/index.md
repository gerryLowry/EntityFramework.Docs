# Getting Started with EF Core on Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

These 101-level tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework Core or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple Universal Window Platform (UWP) application that queries and saves data from a database using EF Core.

More details about developing UWP applications can be found in the [UWP documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/develop/).
