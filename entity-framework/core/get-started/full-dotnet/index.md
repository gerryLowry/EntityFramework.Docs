# Getting Started with EF Core on .NET Framework

These 101-level tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework Core or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple .NET Framework Console Application that queries and saves data from a database. You can choose a tutorial that creates a model based on an existing database, or creates a database for you based on your model.

You can use the techniques learned in these tutorials in any application that targets the .NET Framework, including WPF and WinForms.

> [!NOTE]  
> These tutorials and the accompanying samples have been updated to use EF Core 2.1. However, in the majority of cases it should be possible to create applications that use previous releases, with minimal modification to the instructions.
