# What is new in EF Core 3.0 (currently in preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the feature sets and schedules of future releases are always subject to change, and although we will try to keep this page up to date, it may not reflect our latest plans at all times.

EF Core 3.0 is currently under development and available in preview. EF Core 3.0 will bring a set of [new features](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/features) and also [breaking changes](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0/breaking-changes) you should be aware of when upgrading.

It is early in the release and current [preview packages published to the NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/)Â only contain breaking changes and minor improvements we have made in preparation for the rest of the 3.0 work. 

Successive preview releases will contain more of the planned features. In the meantime, you can use [this query in our issue tracker](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.0+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to see work items assigned to 3.0.
