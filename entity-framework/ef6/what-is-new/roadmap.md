# Future Versions of Entity Framework 
Here you can find information on upcoming versions of Entity Framework.
While most of the focus of the EF team is nowadays on adding new features and improvements to [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/index), we plan to  still fix important bugs, implement small improvements, and incorporate community contributions in the EF6 codebase.

## Post-EF 6.2 releases

The roadmap of post-EF 6.2 releases is still being developed. More information will be posted here once available.
 
## Staying Up To Date  
  
Besides this page, new releases are usually announced on the [.NET team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/tag/entity-framework/) and our 
Twitter account, [@efmagicunicorns](http://twitter.com/efmagicunicorns).
