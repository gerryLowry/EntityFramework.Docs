# Get Help Using Entity Framework
## ![StackOverflow](~/ef6/media/stackoverflow.png) Questions About Using EF  

The best way to get help using Entity Framework is to [post a question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) using the **entity-framework** tag.  

If you are not familiar with Stack Overflow, be sure to [read the guidelines on asking questions](http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking). In particular, do not use Stack Overflow to report bugs, ask roadmap questions, or suggest new features.  

## ![GitHub Mark](~/ef6/media/github-mark-32px.png) Bug Reports and Feature Requests  

If you have found a bug that you think should be fixed, have a feature you would like to see implemented, or a question you couldn't find an answer to, create an issue on [the EF6 GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6/issues).
